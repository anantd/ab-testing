# A/B Testing

Notes and resources on A/B testing and online experimentation.

## General reading

*The Surprising Power of Online Experiments*, Kohavi and Thomke
https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments
Good background info about the overall goals and advantages of successful A/B testing.

*Controlled experiments on the web*, Kohavi et al
This paper outlines the key concepts in online experimentation. Includes examples, key definitions and formulas, as well as pros and cons of different approaches.

*A/B Testing at Stack Overflow*, Julia Silge, Stack Overlflow:
https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/17/power-calculations-p-values-ab-testing-stack-overflow/
https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/power-app/
This blog post offers a clear high-level overview of Stack Overflow's A/B testing procedure; includes a Shiny app that illustrates power calculations.

A more customizable sample size calculator, created by Evan Miller, is available here:

Udacity A/B testing notes:
https://towardsdatascience.com/a-summary-of-udacity-a-b-testing-course-9ecc32dedbb1
Notes from Udacity's course on A/B testing

http://thestatsgeek.com/2013/07/22/ab-testing/
Basic introduction about the chi-squared test and how it's used for A/B testing.

*Effective A/B testing*, Ben Tilly
http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/
This slide has a complete walkthrough of the A/B testing process using the G-test (a more modern version of the chi square test).

## Bayesian A/B testing

*The Power of Bayesian A/B Testing*, Michael Frasco, Convoy
https://medium.com/convoy-tech/the-power-of-bayesian-a-b-testing-f859d2219d5
Offers a good overview of the advantages of adopting a Bayesian methodology for experimentation.

*Bayesian A/B Testing at Visual Website Optimizer*, Chris Stucchio
https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/310840/VWO_SmartStats_technical_whitepaper.pdf
This whitepaper fully breaks down VWO's methodology for Bayesian A/B testing.
Breaks down the same methodology in a presentation, slides available here:
